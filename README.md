LolToml [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andrusha97/loltoml.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andrusha97/loltoml)
=======

WARNING: work in progress.

Loltoml is a library implementing SAX-style parser of the [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml) language.
This library aims to support the latest version of TOML until TOML 1.0 is released.
So any breaking changes in the language spec will be reflected in the library. Beware.
Currently supported version is [0.4](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/tree/v0.4.0).

It's header-only and depends only on the C++ standard library.
